The engine is preferably operated to burn Hydrogen fuel in a charged mode and lean mode at certain acceptable air fuel ratios where relatively little NOx emissions occur. When additional power or acceleration is requested, processor controlled fuel injectors are operated to inject relatively small amounts of gasoline into the engine resulting in a fuel mixture that prevents increases in NOx emissions as the processor operates at a stoichiometric air fuel ratio where a catalytic converter is best able to reduce harmful emissions.
