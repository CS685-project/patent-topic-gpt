The sailing stop control stops a drive source of the vehicle and releases an engaging element provided between the drive source and a drive wheel such that the vehicle travels under inertia. The vehicle control method acquires information on a road on which the vehicle will travel, and then determines whether there is a section on a route where the sailing stop control can be executed based on the information. Upon determining a section exist capable of the sailing stop control, the vehicle control method estimates a power shortage amount, which is a shortage amount of power during sailing stop control, based on the information, and charges a battery with power required to cover the power shortage amount prior to starting the sailing stop control.","cpc_id":["B60W 20\/14","B60W 20\/12","B60W 60\/0023","B60W 10\/04","B60W 10\/26","B60W 30\/181","B60W 2556\/10","B60W 2556\/65","B60W 2050\/0014","B60W 2510\/244","B60W 50\/0097","B60W 2554\/406","B60W 2556\/50","B60W 2510\/1005","B60W 2552\/15","B60W 2520\/10","B60W 2520\/105","B60W 2540\/10","B60W 2510\/305","B60W 30\/18127","B60W 2030\/1809","B60W 30\/18072","B60W 10\/02","B60W 10\/06","B60W 10\/08","B60W 20\/13","Y02T 10\/70","Y02T 10\/60","Y02T 10\/62"]}
