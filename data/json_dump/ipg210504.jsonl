{"patent_number": "US-10999793-B2", "abstract": "Techniques are disclosed for reducing power consumption on a power sensitive wireless device, such as for example a digital wireless camera operating on a battery. According to some techniques, power can be reduced when a portable device is in close proximity to the power sensitive wireless device, such as when a person is home and the recording of video on a digital wireless security camera can be disarmed. Some techniques include filtering mechanisms, which reduce unnecessary information being transmitted to the wireless network circuit of the power sensitive wireless device. Other techniques include modifying or adapting IEEE 802.11 standards to achieve power reducing results such as for example reducing the number of times to wake up to receive the beacons. Also, improved synchronization techniques are implemented such as for example improved synchronization accuracy allows reducing the duration of the wake time for receiving the beacons.", "cpc_id": ["Y02D 70/142", "Y02D 70/144", "H04W 84/12", "H04W 48/16", "H04W 52/0216", "H04W 64/00"]}

Each wireless terminal (302) is capable of supporting multiple separate timing and/or other control loops one, for each base station connection thereby allowing the connections to operate independently and in parallel. Different control signals and/or data are transmitted on each connection that is established with a base station (302, 306). In this manner base stations (302, 306) receive different data allowing for asynchronous data transmission.
