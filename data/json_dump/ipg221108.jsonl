When a segment is unoccupied, energy is saved by closing the adjoining gates and deactivating the associated segment pump, thereby deactivating the segment and allowing the segment's internal pressure to rise due to leakage. As a vehicle approaches, the segment pump is reactivated, lowering the internal pressure to the operating vacuum, and the gates are opened. Embodiments include a boom-tank system that can accelerate re-evacuation of a segment having an increased internal pressure by establishing fluid communication with at least one recently deactivated segment having a lower internal pressure. As a vehicle transits the conduit, a rolling, contiguous group of activated segments surrounding and in advance of the vehicle can be maintained.","cpc_id":["B61B 13\/122","B61B 13\/08","B61B 13\/10","B60V 3\/04","B60L 13\/06","F16K 3\/30","F16K 3\/34","Y02T 30\/00"]}

The Ti-containing zeolites provide excellent selectivity to light olefins as well as exceptionally high hydrothermal stability. The coupled reaction may advantageously be conducted in a staged reactor with methanol\/DME conversion zones alternating with zones for butane(s) dehydrogenation.
