The method includes biological hydrogen production, followed by a gravity settler positioned downstream of the CSTR, which combination forms a biohydrogenator. The biomass concentration in the hydrogen reactor is kept at the desired range through biomass recirculation from the bottom of the gravity settler and\/or biomass wastage from the gravity settler's underflow. The gravity setter effluent is loaded with volatile fatty acids, as a result of microbiological breakdown of the influent waste constituents by hydrogen-producing bacteria, and is an excellent substrate for methane-forming bacteria in the downstream biomethanator.","cpc_id":["C12P 3\/00","C12P 5\/023","C12P 39\/00","C12P 7\/04","C12P 7\/08","C12P 7\/16","C12P 7\/28","C12P 7\/40","C12P 7\/6409","Y02E 50\/343","Y02E 50\/17","Y02E 20\/16","Y02E 20\/18","C12M 21\/04","C12M 23\/58","C12M 29\/18","C12M 21\/12","C12M 41\/26","C12M 27\/02","C12M 29\/26","C12M 33\/22","C12M 41\/14","C12M 29\/20","C12M 23\/40","C12M 25\/00","C12M 29\/02","C12M 29\/24","C12M 41\/44","C12M 41\/46","C12M 41\/48","C12M 43\/00","C12M 43\/04","C12M 29\/00","C12M 41\/12","C12M 45\/04","C12M 45\/20","C12M 47\/10","C12M 47\/18","C12M 35\/02","C10G 2\/32","C10G 2\/34","C10G 11\/18","C10G 1\/00","C10G 1\/02","C10G 1\/10","C10G 31\/08","C10G 33\/00","C10G 45\/00","C10G 57\/00","C10G 75\/04","C10G 7\/00","C10G 7\/003","C10G 7\/06","C12N 1\/20","Y02P 30\/30","Y02P 10\/143","Y02P 20\/129","Y02P 30\/446","C02F 3\/2813","C02F 3\/34","C02F 1\/00","C12F 3\/02","C25B 1\/00","C25B 1\/02","C25B 9\/00","C25B 9\/06","B01D 3\/06","B01D 53\/48","B01D 53\/62","B01J 19\/0093","B01J 19\/24","B01J 2219\/00864","B01J 2219\/00867","B01J 2219\/00871","B01J 2\/00","B01J 6\/008","B02C 23\/00","B03C 1\/00","B09B 5\/00","B22F 2009\/001","B22F 3\/10","B22F 9\/00","B29B 17\/00","C01B 13\/02","C01B 17\/02","C01B 17\/027","C01B 17\/48","C01B 17\/74","C01B 2203\/0205","C01B 2203\/0283","C01B 2203\/043","C01B 2203\/0445","C01B 2203\/0475","C01B 32\/05","C01B 32\/20","C01B 32\/50","C01B 3\/32","C01G 21\/02","C10J 2300\/093","C10J 2300\/0946","C10J 3\/72","C10L 2290\/544","C10L 9\/10","C22B 13\/00","C22B 15\/00","C22B 21\/00","C22B 7\/00","C22B 9\/00","F27B 17\/00","H01M 10\/54","H01M 8\/00","H02K 55\/02","H02K 7\/09","Y02W 10\/33","Y02W 10\/37","Y02W 30\/84"]}
