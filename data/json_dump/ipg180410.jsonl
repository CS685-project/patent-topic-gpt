The WTRU estimates a transmit power for each of a plurality of available transport format combinations (TFCs). A TFC is selected for an uplink dedicated channel and a TFC is selected for an enhanced uplink (EU) channel. The TFC for the dedicated channel is selected first and independently of the TFC selection of the EU channel. The TFC for the EU channel is selected within a remaining WTRU transmit power after the TFC selection for the dedicated channel.","cpc_id":["H04W 72\/02","H04W 52\/146","H04W 52\/226","H04W 52\/262","H04W 52\/267","H04W 52\/286","H04W 52\/346","H04W 52\/60","Y02B 60\/50"]}
{"patent_number":"US-09942959-B1","abstract":"The present invention discloses a wide input voltage phase-cut dimming power supply, which is embedded in an overall dimming circuit. The overall dimming circuit includes an electric network power supply, a phase-cut dimmer, a dimming power supply, and an LED light. The dimming power supply includes an anti-interference circuit, an active power factor correction circuit, a power conversion circuit, a dimmer current maintaining circuit, a wide input voltage phase-cut dimming control circuit, and a filed effect transistor. Compared to the prior art, the present invention can realize a wide input voltage within 90-305V, which is suitable for most of electric networks around the world. Furthermore, the present invention uses a PWM control mode, so that it can control brightness of the LED lights with different colors, and be compatible with a leading edge dimmer or a trailing edge dimmer.","cpc_id":["H05B 33\/0815","H05B 33\/0818","H05B 33\/0845","H05B 33\/0851","H05B 37\/02","H05B 41\/38","H05B 41\/3924","H05B 41\/3927","Y02B 20\/346"]}
{"patent_number":"US-09942962-B2","abstract":"An electronic device is provided in which a dedicated area of the device substrate is patterned to form a resistive track so that it can be contacted by a readout arrangement. The resistive track is used to encode information. The information is provided to a driver which can then derive information about the type of device being driven. The driver can thus be controlled accordingly.","cpc_id":["H01L 51\/5012","H01L 51\/5203","H01L 51\/5206","H01L 51\/5212","H01L 2223\/54493","H01L 2223\/54413","H01L 2251\/5361","H05B 33\/0848","H05B 33\/0896","Y02B 20\/36"]}
