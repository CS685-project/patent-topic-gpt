This self-alignment maximizes effectiveness of energy conversion by ODSC converter installed in the floating power plant. The ODSC converter comprises 3 main structures, a plurality of attenuators, a one-way clutch and meshing gear system, and a drive shaft, wherein the whole kinetic energy of the sea wave is captured, transformed, converted and integrated together into a powerful one-way driving torque. The powerful torque then drives an electric generation system directly.

{"patent_number":"US-10516731-B2","abstract":"A method and system are disclosed herein for accepting multimodal inputs and deriving synchronized and processed information. A reusable multimodal application is provided on the mobile device. A user transmits a multimodal command to the multimodal platform via the mobile network. The one or more modes of communication that are inputted are transmitted to the multimodal platform(s) via the mobile network(s) and thereafter synchronized and processed at the multimodal platform. The synchronized and processed information is transmitted to the multimodal application. If required, the user verifies and appropriately modifies the synchronized and processed information. The verified and modified information are transferred from the multimodal application to the visual application. The final result(s) are derived by inputting the verified and modified results into the visual application.","cpc_id":["H04W 52\/0251","H04W 4\/02","H04W 52\/283","Y02B 60\/50"]}

{"patent_number":"US-10517088-B2","abstract":"An MTC method includes: a base station receives a terminal identity and business registration information from a terminal, the business registration information including a business type and service subscription information; the base station allocates time-frequency reporting resource information to the terminal according to the business registration information; the base station sends the time-frequency reporting resource information to the terminal; and the base station receives an uplink data packet from the terminal according to the time-frequency reporting resource information. In the embodiment, the base station allocates the time-frequency reporting resource information to the terminal to ensure that the terminal sends the uplink data packet to the base station. Such a scheduling process is simple and consistent, which can reduce complexity and power consumption of MTC, and can further reduce deployment cost of an MTC system and prolong the service life of battery-powered equipment.","cpc_id":["H04W 72\/044","H04W 4\/08","H04W 76\/10","H04W 4\/70","H04W 72\/04","H04W 88\/08","H04W 52\/0261","Y02D 70\/20"]}
