{"patent_number":"US-11319871-B2","abstract":"In certain embodiments, Lube Oil Controlled Ignition (LOCI) Engine Combustion overcomes the drawbacks of known combustion technologies. First, lubricating oil is already part of any combustion engine; hence, there is no need to carry a secondary fuel and to have to depend on an additional fuel system as in the case of dual-fuel technologies. Second, the ignition and the start of combustion rely on the controlled autoignition of the lubricating oil preventing the occurrence of abnormal combustion as experienced with the Spark Ignition technology. Third, LOCI combustion is characterized by the traveling of a premixed flame; hence, it has a controllable duration resulting in a wide engine load-speed window unlike the Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition technology where the engine load-speed window is narrow. Adaptive Intake Valve Closure may be used to control in-cylinder compression temperature to be high enough to realize the consistent auto ignition of the lubricating oil mist.","cpc_id":["F02B 43\/10","F02B 1\/12","F02B 2043\/103","F02B 2275\/14","F02D 13\/0234","F02D 13\/0269","F02D 19\/022","F02D 19\/024","F02D 19\/10","F02M 21\/0254","F02M 21\/0257","F02M 21\/0275","Y02T 10\/12","Y02T 10\/30"]}
