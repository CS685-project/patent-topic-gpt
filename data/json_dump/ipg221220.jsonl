{"patent_number":"US-11530020-B2","abstract":"A method and device is provided for increasing the efficiency of jet drives by recuperating effective power from the propulsion flow. A ducted propeller in the propeller housing, driven by a driving engine via a drive shaft, conveys the fluid for the jet drive out of the interior Vi of a radial turbine. The fluid is accelerated axially and ejected backwards against the direction of travel. This creates thrust. Because the pressure in the interior of the turbine decreases, new fluid from the environment flows directly via the blades of the rotating radial turbine from the outside to the inside, thereby driving them. A guide apparatus is missing. The power of the radial turbine is transmitted via a transmission to the drive shaft of the propeller, which relieves the driving engine and increases the efficiency of the jet drive.
