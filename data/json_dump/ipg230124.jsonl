The compensation voltage controls an on-time of a main switch of the switching circuit. When the current of the inductor or the transformer drops to a threshold, after a time, the main switch is switched from off to on, and the output feedback voltage controls the time. When the output feedback voltage is higher than a first threshold voltage, the compensation voltage is pulled down. When the output feedback voltage is lower than a second threshold voltage, the compensation voltage is pulled up.","cpc_id":["G05F 1\/00","G05F 1\/10","G05F 1\/12","G05F 1\/46","G05F 1\/455","G05F 1\/45","G05F 1\/445","G05F 1\/66","G05F 1\/40","G05F 1\/42","G05F 1\/44","G05F 1\/462","G05F 1\/52","G05F 1\/56","G05F 3\/10","G05F 3\/16","G05F 3\/18","G05F 3\/185","G05F 3\/20","G05F 3\/26","G05F 3\/30","G05F 3\/205","G05F 3\/22","G05F 3\/24","G05F 3\/222","G05F 3\/242","G05F 3\/225","G05F 3\/227","G05F 3\/245","G05F 3\/247","G05F 3\/262","G05F 3\/265","G05F 3\/267","G05F 1\/575","H02M 5\/2573","H02M 1\/081","H02M 5\/293","H02M 7\/12","H02M 3\/10","H02M 3\/125","H02M 3\/13","H02M 3\/135","H02M 3\/145","H02M 3\/15","H02M 3\/155","H02M 3\/156","H02M 3\/158","H02M 3\/1588","H02M 2003\/1566","H02M 3\/1582","H02M 2003\/1557","H02M 3\/22","H02M 1\/08","H02M 1\/36","H02M 3\/24","H02M 3\/325","H02M 3\/335","H02M 3\/28","H02M 3\/33569","H02M 3\/33507","H02M 2007\/4815","H02M 2007\/4818","H02M 1\/083","H02M 3\/33538","H02M 3\/33546","H02M 3\/33515","H02M 3\/33576","H02M 3\/33592","H02M 3\/33553","H02M 3\/33523","H05B 39\/048","B23K 11\/24","H04B 2215\/069","Y02B 70\/1491"]}
