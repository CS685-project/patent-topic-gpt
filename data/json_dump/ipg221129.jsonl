The changes can include using an air separation unit to provide an oxygen source with a reduced or minimized content of nitrogen and\/or operating the reactor at elevated pressure during the regeneration stage. By operating the regeneration at elevated pressure, a regeneration flue gas can be generated that is enriched in CO2 at elevated pressure. The CO2-enriched stream can include primarily water as a contaminant, which can be removed by cooling while substantially maintaining the pressure of the stream. This can facilitate subsequent recovery and use of the CO2.","cpc_id":["C01B 3\/384","C01B 3\/40","C01B 3\/48","C01B 3\/56","C01B 2203\/0233","C01B 2203\/0283","C01B 2203\/042","C01B 2203\/0475","C01B 2203\/0822","C01B 2203\/1094","C01B 2203\/1241","C01B 2203\/043","C01B 2203\/0827","C01B 2203\/1023","C01B 2203\/1047","C01B 2203\/1058","C01B 2203\/1076","C01B 2203\/1082","C01B 3\/46","B01D 53\/047","B01D 2256\/16","B01D 2257\/502","B01D 2257\/504","B01D 2257\/80","B01J 8\/0492","B01J 8\/0496","B01J 12\/007","B01J 19\/2465","B01J 23\/34","B01J 23\/92","B01J 35\/04","B01J 38\/14","B01J 38\/40","Y02C 20\/40","Y02P 30\/00"]}
