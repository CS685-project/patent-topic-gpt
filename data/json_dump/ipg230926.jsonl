When the flexible touchscreen layer is moved from the closed state to the open state, at least part of the bendable portion may be led into the recess to expose at least one of an inner structure having various modules disposed thereon or electronic component for access and/or use.", "cpc_id": ["H10K 77/111", "H10K 50/841", "H10K 59/12", "H10K 59/40", "H10K 59/65", "H10K 2102/311", "G06F 1/1601", "G06F 3/041", "G06F 3/0488", "G06F 1/163", "G06F 1/1652", "G06F 2203/04102", "G06F 1/1628", "G06F 1/1686", "G06F 1/1688", "G06F 1/169", "H04M 1/0235", "H04M 1/0245", "H04M 1/0268", "G09G 2354/00", "Y02E 10/549"]}
