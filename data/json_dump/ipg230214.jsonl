{"patent_number":"US-11576401-B2","abstract":"The group of inventions relates to the food industry, and more particularly to a method and device for transforming brewer's spent grain (BSG). The invention makes it possible to increase the level of recovery of edible fractions from BSG to 90-95%, and to increase the amount of protein in an edible suspension to not less than 50 wt % dry solids. The underlying principle of the invention is a technique for preparing BSG for nutrient extraction and extracting said nutrients by mechanical processing on a proposed industrial processing line. The essence of the claimed method lies in loosening BSG on a vibratory sieve, grinding the BSG in a colloid mill with the addition of water or centrate in a ratio of from 0.5:1 to 1:1 relative to BSG to produce a paste-like homogeneous mass of BSG, and then processing said mass in a screw extractor for further grinding and separation into two fractions: an edible suspension having a 90-95% moisture content and containing all of the nutrients of BSG, including protein substances; and ground BSG husks having a 60-75% moisture content, suitable for subsequent industrial use. The edible suspension is then mechanically filtered to remove ground husk residue, and the suspension is pumped into a storage tank.","cpc_id":["A23J 1\/12","A23J 3\/14","A23J 1\/16","A23L 33\/75","A23L 33\/115","A23L 33\/21","A23L 33\/185","A23L 33\/175","B02C 4\/04","C12P 21\/02","C12P 21\/06","A23K 10\/38","Y02P 60\/87","A23V 2002\/00","A23V 2250\/5482"]}
