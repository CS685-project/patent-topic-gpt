Hydrogen gas flows out and some of the carbon will deposit on the channel wall. Once carbon deposition reaches a predetermined level, the hydrocarbon flow stops, and air or oxygen is caused to flow into the channels to oxidize carbon into carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide and supply heat to neighboring channels. Simultaneously, the hydrocarbon will flow into neighboring channels causing decomposition into hydrogen and carbon in the neighboring channels. When the carbon coating in the neighboring channels reaches a predetermined level, the gas flow is switched again to air or oxygen. In this way, each channel alternates between decomposing the hydrocarbon and oxidizing the deposited carbon.","cpc_id":["C01B 3\/24","C01B 32\/40","C01B 32\/50","C01B 2203\/0255","C01B 2203\/0272","C01B 2203\/1235","C01B 2203\/148","C01B 2203\/0838","C01B 2203\/1241","C01B 2203\/1247","C01B 2203\/16","B01J 19\/2445","B01J 19\/248","B01J 2219\/00051","B01J 2219\/00164","B01J 2219\/0218","Y02E 60\/36","Y02E 60\/50"]}
