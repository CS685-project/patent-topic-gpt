{"patent_number":"US-09899931-B1","abstract":"A flyback converter implements a Forced Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) timing control by detecting a positive current excursion of the secondary winding current as the synchronous rectifier turn off trigger. The synchronous rectifier switch is turned on near the end of the switching cycle or the on duration is extended to develop a current ripple on the secondary winding current. The control circuit of the flyback converter detects a positive current excursion on the secondary winding current to turn off the synchronous rectifier and to start the next switching cycle. At this point, the voltage across the primary switch has been discharged and the primary switch can be turned on with zero drain-to-source voltage. In other embodiments, zero voltage switching for the off-transition of the primary switch is realized by coupling a capacitor across the primary switch or by coupling a capacitor across the primary winding, or both.","cpc_id":["H02M 3\/335","H02M 3\/33507","H02M 3\/33523","H02M 3\/33561","H02M 3\/33569","H02M 3\/33592","H02M 2007\/4815","H02M 3\/156-158","H02M 3\/1563","H02M 2001\/0032","Y02B 70\/126","Y02B 70\/1433","Y02B 70\/1441","Y02B 70\/1475"]}

The vibrators have the ability to shake and resonate the transparent shield, dislodging the dust particulates from their positions. A compressor powered by the PV panel compresses air before a dust cleaning\/cooling process, in which a short duration release of the compressed air creates an air stream over the PV panel that removes the loose dust particulates and cools the PV panel to enhance performance. Using a microcontroller-based timer, the dust cleaning\/cooling process is timed for daily operation before noon, when the PV panel temperature is at its peak to maximize PV panel efficiency at maximum irradiance time.","cpc_id":["B08B 17\/02","B08B 5\/02","B08B 7\/02","F24J 2\/461","H01L 31\/042","H02S 40\/10","H02S 40\/38","H02S 40\/425","Y02E 10\/40","Y02E 10\/50"]}
