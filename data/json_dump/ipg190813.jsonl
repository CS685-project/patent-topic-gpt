The result consists in a more reliable, special structure and a simple composition of uranium dioxide without heterogeneous fuel pellet additives, approaching the characteristics of a monocrystal having enhanced, and specifically exceeding reference data, thermal conductivity as temperature increases, and a simple production method thereof. The result is achieved in that pores of between 1 and 5 microns in size are distributed along the perimeters of grains in the micro-structure of each metal cluster in a nuclear fuel pellet, and in that located within the grains are pores which are predominantly nano-sized. In addition, the metal clusters comprise between 0.01 and 1.0 percent by mass.
