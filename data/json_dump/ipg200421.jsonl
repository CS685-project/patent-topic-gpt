{"patent_number": "US-10631359-B2", "abstract": "Technology for a mobile station (MS) configured for cellular Internet of Things (CIoT) is disclosed. The MS can receive a ready state discontinuous reception (RS-DRX) configuration message from a base station, wherein the RS-DRX configuration message includes one or more RS-DRX parameters. The MS can initiate RS-DRX based on the one or more RS-DRX parameters included in the RS-DRX configuration message. The RS-DRX can enable the MS to be in a packet idle state of a ready state in between data communications by the MS with the base station.
