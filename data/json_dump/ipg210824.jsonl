The descriptors define instructions for performing a pass of a DNN by the DNN processor. Several types of descriptors can be utilized: memory-to-memory move (M2M) descriptors; operation descriptors; host communication descriptors; configuration descriptors; branch descriptors; and synchronization descriptors. A DMA engine uses M2M descriptors to perform multi-dimensional strided DMA operations. Operation descriptors define the type of operation to be performed by neurons in the DNN processor and the activation function to be used by the neurons. M2M descriptors are buffered separately from operation descriptors and can be executed at soon as possible, subject to explicitly set dependencies. As a result, latency can be reduced and, consequently, the neurons can complete their processing faster.
