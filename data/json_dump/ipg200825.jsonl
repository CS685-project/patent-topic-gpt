{"patent_number":"US-10757686-B2","abstract":"Disclosed are a data transmission method, device, and system, which are used for resolving the problem of large overhead if an existing manner of sending a public message periodically is used in an ultra-dense network. The method comprises: user equipment sends an uplink request message, the uplink request message being used for requesting for obtaining public information of a first access node in an area in which the user equipment is located; and the user equipment receives the public information sent by the first access node. Because an access node in an area in which user equipment is located does not need to broadcast and send public information periodically, the access node can send, based on an uplink request of the user equipment, the public information, thereby improving the resource utilization and reducing the energy consumption.","cpc_id":["H04W 72\/0406","H04W 74\/0833","H04W 72\/048","H04W 48\/16","H04W 74\/08","H04W 72\/042","H04W 72\/0446","H04W 72\/0453","H04W 36\/38","H04W 36\/22","H04W 36\/32","H04W 36\/34","H04W 36\/08","H04W 36\/14","Y02D 70\/1262","Y02D 70\/126"]}
{"patent_number":"US-10757731-B2","abstract":"Some embodiments are directed to grouping electronic devices into contention groups to reduce uplink Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) random access (OFDMA-RA) collisions. An access point may explicitly assign an electronic device to a contention group, or the electronic device may implicitly determine an assignment to the contention group. To explicitly assign a device to a contention group, the access point may randomly assign or assign based on a criteria of the electronic device. Examples of criteria include an association identifier (AID), a traffic type\/quality of service (QoS) category, a power saving preference, and an association status. The electronic device may implicitly determine a contention group assignment based on the total number of contention groups. The electronic device may use the explicitly or implicitly assigned contention group number to determine whether the electronic device may contend for a given trigger frame random access (TF-R) frame.","cpc_id":["H04W 74\/006","H04W 74\/0833","H04L 5\/0007","Y02B 60\/50"]}
