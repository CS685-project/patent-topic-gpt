{"patent_number":"US-11805061-B2","abstract":"A method of congestion control implemented by a sender over a network link that includes a router having a queue. During a first state, information is received from a receiver. The information comprises an estimated maximum bandwidth for the link, a one-way transit time for traffic over the link, and an indication whether the network link is congested. In response to the link being congested, the sender transitions to a second state. While in the second state, a sending rate of packets in reduced, in part to attempt to drain the queue of data packets contributed by the sender. The sender transitions to a third state when the sender estimates that the queue has been drained of the data packets contributed. During the third state, the sending rate is increased until either the sender transitions back to the first state, or receives a new indication that the link is congested.","cpc_id":["H04L 47\/24","H04L 47\/125","H04L 12\/4633","H04L 12\/4641","H04L 12\/4625","H04L 47\/263","Y02D 30\/50"]}

Some implementations more specifically relate to facilitating coexistence among wireless communication devices that support synchronized channel access and those that do not. A group of access points may schedule periodically recurring, synchronized channel access periods by periodically transmitting quiet elements. The quiet elements establish recurring quiet periods during which legacy devices are not permitted to transmit. In some implementations, an access point may transmit one or more quiet override elements each associated with a respective quiet element and indicating to other access points supporting synchronized channel access that they are permitted to contend for access during the respective quiet period. In some other implementations of synchronized channel access, an access point supporting synchronized channel access that wins contention after one or more consecutive synchronized channel access periods during which no other synchronized access points won contention, may be entitled to an extended TXOP.","cpc_id":["H04W 52\/0212","H04W 52\/0216","H04W 52\/0258","H04W 72\/1205","Y02D 30\/70"]}
