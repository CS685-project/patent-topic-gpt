Legacy subscribers are also not affected.","cpc_id":["H04W 48\/00","H04W 48\/18","H04W 68\/00","H04W 72\/00","H04W 72\/04","H04W 72\/12","H04W 84\/027","H04W 88\/06","Y02B 60\/14","Y02B 60\/142","Y02B 60\/144","Y02B 60\/16","Y02B 60\/167","Y02B 60\/40","Y02B 60\/50","Y02D 70\/00","Y02D 70\/146","Y02D 70\/1242","Y02D 70\/1262","Y02D 70\/1222","Y02D 70\/144","Y02D 70\/1264","Y02D 70\/164","Y02D 70\/24"]}
{"patent_number":"US-10390408-B2","abstract":"An apparatus facilitating luminosity uniformity across an organic light emitting diode (OLED) device is provided. In one embodiment, the method includes: operating an organic light emitting diode (OLED) device including an anode; a semiconductor material coupled to the anode; and a cathode coupled to the semiconductor material. The method also includes dissipating heat of the OLED device in a defined pattern to increase a luminosity uniformity of the OLED device, wherein the dissipating the heat in the defined pattern comprises causing a first temperature value at a first region of the OLED device and causing a second temperature value at a second region of the OLED device.","cpc_id":["H05B 33\/0896","H01L 51\/5203","H01L 51\/529","Y02B 20\/36"]}
{"patent_number":"US-10390411-B2","abstract":"A method of automatically commissioning a lighting system comprising a plurality of luminaires for illuminating one or more regions within a space. The method comprises: receiving signals from a positioning system, indicating a respective location within the space at which each of a plurality of physical entities is detected by the positioning system, each of the entities being a person or a movable nonhuman object. The method further comprises determining a spatial distribution of at least some of the entities based on the locations indicated by the signals from the positioning system, and determining a region within the space corresponding to this spatial distribution. The method then comprises identifying a group of the luminaires that are arranged to illuminate the determined region and storing identifiers of those luminaires together as a group in a commissioning database.","cpc_id":["H05B 37\/02","H05B 37\/029","H05B 37\/0227","H05B 37\/0272","H05B 37\/0245","H05B 33\/0854","H05B 33\/0869","H05B 33\/0845","G05B 2919\/163","G05B 2919\/2642","G05B 2219\/25011","G05B 2219\/25168","Y02B 20\/44","F21V 23\/0471"]}
