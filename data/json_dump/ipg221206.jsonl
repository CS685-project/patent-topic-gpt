In one aspect, the system can increase nuclear power plant safety by preventing the escape of liquid and solid radioactive materials (corium) from a melt confinement device in the event of a serious accident involving the escape of core melt from a nuclear reactor. The invention addresses the problem of increasing the efficiency and reliability of a melt confinement device by improving the conditions for cooling corium. The problem is solved by the use of a filler formed in upper cassettes and in a lower cassette. Said cassettes are configured with vertical and horizontal channels which provide for the uniform distribution of melt in the housing undergoing cooling.", "cpc_id": ["G21C 9/016", "G21C 13/10", "G21C 15/18", "Y02E 30/30"]}
