The asymmetric twin scroll turbine 10 includes a first scroll 11 and second scroll 12 wherein the first scroll 11 is larger and has greater mass flow capacity than the second scroll 12. The larger volute increases flow capacity and counteracts backpressure creating evenly balanced or equalized peak pressures and pulsations between both volutes and balancing of gas flow between cylinder sets. By equalizing peak pressures, pulsations, and gas flow between cylinder sets, engine self-ignition can be avoided in the cylinder set that would have had the largest peak pressures and pulsations. By in creasing flow capacity of the larger volute and balancing gas flow between cylinder sets, the turbine pressure differential is reduced and the engine can operate more efficiently, improving fuel economy.","cpc_id":["A61K 41\/0042","A61K 9\/06","A61K 47\/34","A61K 47\/10","C08G 65\/33327","C08G 65\/3344","C08G 2650\/04","C08G 2210\/00","F01D 9\/026","F01D 25\/24","F02B 37\/00","F02B 33\/40","F02B 37\/025","F05D 2220\/40","Y02T 10\/144","F01N 13\/107"]}
