{"patent_number": "US-10050696-B2", "abstract": "A directional repeater system is presented with a simple architecture composed of wideband receive and transmit antennas, a high gain low-power amplifier and a bandpass filter suitable for use in the 2450 MHz ISM band. Close to 70 dB of isolation between transmit and receive antennas over the entire band is achieved for a compact structure. The isolation between the transmit and receive antennas is achieved using polarization mismatch between orthogonal double-stack patch antennas and a two-element receive antenna whose elements are appropriately located with respect to the edge of the substrate ground plane and the transmit antenna to cancel the signal leakage from the transmit antenna to the individual receive antennas. A major advantage of this invention is that the entire bandwidth can be used going through a chain of repeaters whereas for conventional repeaters the available bandwidth is halved for every repeater in the chain.", "cpc_id": ["H04B 7/155", "Y02D 70/12", "Y02D 70/122"]}
