One DC input polarity is selectively switched to an output terminal when the instantaneous AC output from a second output terminal is desired to be of the opposite polarity, while the other DC input polarity is used to form an approximation to a segment of a sine wave of the desired polarity at the second output terminal. The approximation for each phase is built in a multilevel fashion by outputting, at different times, voltage levels that differ by an integer multiple of a predetermined voltage step size, to the respective live AC output terminal through an associated low pass filter. A common-mode AC signal is thereby created on the balanced DC input lines at a frequency which is the AC output frequency times the number of phases, and which is useful for detecting ground faults in the DC circuit.","cpc_id":["H02J 7\/35","H02J 3\/007","H02J 3\/00","H02J 3\/005","H02J 3\/383","H02J 7\/0068","H02J 9\/061","H02J 300\/00","H02J 2300\/22","H02M 7\/537","H02M 1\/32","H02M 1\/36","H02M 7\/53871","Y02A 30\/00","Y02B 10\/10","Y10T 307\/367","Y10T 307\/391","Y10T 307\/625","H02H 3\/16","Y02E 10\/56"]}
