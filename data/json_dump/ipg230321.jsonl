A user equipment (UE) may receive, via a control channel in a primary cell, one or more downlink control information (DCI) messages that include a secondary cell (SCell) dormancy indication and a request for hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) feedback. The DCI messages may have a format associated with downlink scheduling, and fields used to carry the SCell dormancy indication and the request for HARQ feedback may have a configuration that depends on whether the DCI messages are used to schedule a downlink data transmission. Furthermore, in some aspects, a DCI message may include a field that has a value to indicate whether the DCI message does or does not schedule a downlink data transmission, to enable the UE to correctly receive and decode the SCell dormancy indication and the request for HARQ feedback.", "cpc_id": ["H04L 1/1812", "H04L 1/1864", "H04W 52/0229", "H04W 72/042", "Y02D 30/70"]}
{"patent_number": "US-11611907-B2", "abstract": "A system and method for detecting the presence of a Bluetooth or Zigbee signal within a short period of time is disclosed. The signal identification circuit has two stages, a first stage that processes windows to determine whether noise is present, and a second stage that processes long windows to determine whether the signal is a particular lower-power network protocol. The signal identification circuit can be configured to detect Bluetooth at 1 Mbps, Bluetooth at 2 Mbps or Zigbee. The signal identification signal may be used to allow a lower-power network controller to coexist with a high duty cycle WiFi controller. The signal identification circuit may also be used for other functions, such as powering on a lower-power network controller, determining CCA, or determining which channel a packet is being transmitted on.", "cpc_id": ["H04L 1/1685", "H04L 27/0012", "H04L 27/0014", "H04L 2027/0026", "H04W 28/14", "H04W 4/80", "H04W 72/1215", "H04W 72/14", "H04W 84/12", "H04W 88/06", "H04W 84/18", "H04W 24/08", "Y02D 30/70"]}
{"patent_number": "US-11611916-B2", "abstract": "Methods, systems, and devices for wireless communications are described. Generally, the described techniques provide for using layer one (L1) or layer two (L2) signaling to indicate a primary cell (PCell) or primary secondary cell (PSCell) to a user equipment (UE). The use of L1 or L2 signaling to indicate a PCell or PSCell may be referred to as L1 or L2 mobility and may lower the latency at the UE associated with transitioning to communicating with the PCell or PSCell. A UE may receive radio resource control (RRC) signaling from a base station indicating a set of cells configured for L1 or L2 mobility and indicating a list of candidate cells for a PCell or PSCell. The UE may then receive L1/L2 signaling from the base station identifying the PCell or indicating activation of the PSCell.", "cpc_id": ["H04W 36/0061", "H04W 36/08", "H04W 36/0069", "Y02D 30/70"]}
