The function of the AC grid and AC/DC converter is to create and regulate the DC bus voltage. The function of the PV power is to provide as much power as required to the DC loads. Since the conversion efficiency of the DC/DC pre-conditioner is much higher than that of the AC/DC converter, the conversion loss is greatly reduced if the load is mainly powered from PV instead of AC grid. In addition, a battery can be attached to the bus through a battery charger/controller, which is a bi-directional DC/DC converter.", "cpc_id": ["H02J 2001/002", "Y02E 10/563"]}
