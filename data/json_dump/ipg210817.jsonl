A STP engine designates the first VLT device as a root bridge and, in response, designates the first virtual port a designated port and the second virtual port a root port. The STP engine then designates a networking device coupled to the LAG port as the root bridge based on it having a higher priority than the first VLT device. Then STP engine then determines that a non-LAG link between the networking device and the second VLT device has caused the redesignation of the second virtual port as an alternate port and the non-LAG port as a root port, and swaps the designations of the second virtual port and the non-LAG port.","cpc_id":["H04L 12\/462","H04L 41\/30","H04L 45\/22","H04L 45\/28","H04L 45\/48","H04L 12\/4625","H04L 45\/245","H04L 69\/12","H04L 41\/0893","H04L 45\/00","Y02D 30\/50"]}
