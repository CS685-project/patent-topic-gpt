One method combines cylinder deactivation and mechanical loading of an engine by an electrical generator used to input energy into an exhaust stream to manipulate the exhaust temperature through the combined effect of modified air-to-fuel ratio and supplemental energy input. In particular, cylinder deactivation may be used to modify the engine air flowrate and the electric generator may be used to apply mechanical load on the engine to manipulate the engine fuel flow rate to control the engine air-to-fuel ratio and thereby increase exhaust temperatures.
