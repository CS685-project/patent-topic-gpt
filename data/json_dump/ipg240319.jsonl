{"patent_number":"US-11934750-B2","abstract":"A photovoltaic system's configuration specification can be inferred by an evaluative process that searches through a space of candidate values for the variables in the specification. Each variable is selected in a specific ordering that narrows the field of candidate values. A constant horizon is assumed to account for diffuse irradiance insensitive to specific obstruction locations relative to the photovoltaic system's geographic location. Initial values for the azimuth angle, constant horizon obstruction elevation angle, and tilt angle are determined, followed by final values for these variables. The effects of direct obstructions that block direct irradiance in the areas where the actual horizon and the range of sun path values overlap relative to the geographic location are evaluated to find the exact obstruction elevation angle over a range of azimuth bins or directions. The photovoltaic temperature response coefficient and the inverter rating or power curve of the photovoltaic system are determined.","cpc_id":["G06F 30\/20","G06F 30\/13","G01J 1\/42","G01J 2001\/4266","G01W 1\/12","H02S 50\/00","Y02E 10\/50"]}
