The separated mixture is directed to a gas processor separates the oxygen from the mixture. A nitrogen storage canister coupled to the separated output of the second sieve stores the separated nitrogen, and an oxygen storage canister coupled to the separated output of the first sieve stores and concentrates the separated oxygen until a purity threshold is met.

{"patent_number":"US-10349466-B2","abstract":"Methods, systems, and devices for wireless communication are described. A wireless device may receive data during an active duration of a discontinuous reception (DRX) configuration. The wireless device may be configured such that it identifies a transmission opportunity following the reception opportunity, so that it may transmit a response to the received data during the transmission opportunity. In another example, the wireless device may transmit data during an active duration of a discontinuous transmission (DTX) configuration. The device may be configured such that it identifies a reception opportunity following the DTX active duration, so that a response may be received during the reception opportunity. The presence of a transmission opportunity following a DRX active duration, or a reception opportunity following a DTX active duration may depend on the service type and priority of the data being communicated, and may be either semi-statically configured or dynamically signaled.","cpc_id":["H04W 76\/048","H04W 76\/28","H04W 52\/0219","H04W 52\/0216","H04W 80\/08","H04W 72\/10","Y02D 70\/1264","Y02D 70\/142","Y02D 70\/122","Y02D 70\/1242","Y02D 70\/24","Y02D 70\/1262","Y02D 70\/00","Y02D 70\/22","Y02D 70\/146","Y02D 70\/23","Y02D 70\/25"]}
