As an example, a series of linear and crosslinked polyurethanes were prepared that can be selectively depolymerized under mild conditions. Two unique polyols were synthesized bearing unsaturated units in a configuration designed to favor ring-closing metathesis to five- and six-membered cycloalkenes. These polyols were co-polymerized with toluene diisocyanate to generate linear polyurethanes and trifunctional hexamethylene- and diphenylmethane-based isocyanates to generate crosslinked polyurethanes. The polyol design is such that the ring-closing metathesis reaction cleaves the backbone of the polymer chain. Upon exposure to dilute solutions of Grubbs' catalyst under ambient conditions, the polyurethanes were rapidly depolymerized to low molecular weight, soluble products bearing vinyl and cycloalkene functionalities. These functionalities enabled further re-polymerization by traditional strategies for polymerization of double bonds. This general approach can be expanded to develop a range of chemically recyclable condensation polymers that are readily depolymerized by orthogonal metathesis chemistry.","cpc_id":["C08G 18\/3206","C08G 18\/3212","C08G 2110\/0008","C08G 2110\/0025","C08G 2110\/0083","C08G 18\/675","C08G 18\/723","C08G 18\/7664","C08G 18\/7831","C08G 18\/7621","C08G 18\/725","C07C 6\/04","C08J 11\/10","C08J 2375\/16","C08J 11\/18","C08J 11\/28","C08J 2375\/14","Y02W 30\/62"]}

{"patent_number":"US-11877243-B2","abstract":"A method for reducing power consumption of a terminal that communicates with a base station in a mobile communication system using a multi-carrier structure composed of a primary component carrier and at least one secondary component carrier comprises: receiving a discontinuous reception (DRX) parameter group for multi carriers from the base station; and setting the multi carriers to the same parameter value, by using the received parameter group. The method for reducing power consumption of the terminal further comprises: performing a downlink control channel receive operation on each carrier according to a DRX cycle. As the base station in the mobile communication system using the multi-carrier structure simplifies the DRX process for reducing power consumption of a terminal by reducing signaling load for the multi-carrier control of the terminal, it becomes possible to reduce power consumption of the terminal.","cpc_id":["H04W 72\/042","H04W 72\/23","H04W 88\/02","H04W 88\/08","H04W 28\/0221","H04W 28\/0263","H04W 28\/0278","H04W 76\/28","H04W 76\/27","H04W 52\/0212","H04W 52\/0216","H04W 52\/0219","H04W 52\/0222","H04W 52\/0225","H04W 52\/0229","H04W 52\/0232","H04W 52\/0235","H04W 52\/0261","H04W 52\/0264","H04W 52\/0274","H04W 52\/0277","H04W 52\/028","H04W 52\/0283","Y02D 30\/70","Y02D 70\/1264","Y02D 70\/24","Y02D 70\/00","Y02D 70\/1262","H04L 5\/0001","H04L 5\/001","H04L 5\/06","H04L 5\/14","H04L 5\/16","H04L 5\/18","H04L 5\/26","H04L 5\/0096","H04L 5\/0098","H04L 5\/0053"]}

{"patent_number":"US-11877337-B2","abstract":"Systems, methods, and instrumentalities are disclosed for connectivity supervision and recovery. A WTRU may supervise its capability to transmit and receive data, including in the absence of a control channel (e.g. grant-less transmission). A supervision framework may permit a WTRU to supervise, for example, quality of a feedback channel, quality of reciprocal resources and\/or transmission attempts. A supervision process may be a function of a control channel structure or WTRU state. A supervision process may be associated with a quality of service. A supervision process may be based on WTRU transmission for energy\/resource efficient operation. Multiple Recovery procedures may be defined. A recovery procedure may be a function of a supervision process. A recovery procedure may be optimized for low latency services. Recovery procedures may involve dedicated resources for recovery, transition to light connection, grant-less resource, etc. User plane recovery may include reuse of layer 2 context, data replication to companion MAC instances, etc. Control plane recovery may use RAN paging, WTRU triggered multi-connectivity, etc. A recovery procedure for a supervision process associated with a beam process may include WTRU triggering beam training\/beam refinement, etc.","cpc_id":["H04W 76\/18","H04W 16\/28","H04W 24\/08","H04W 68\/005","H04W 72\/046","H04W 76\/15","H04W 76\/19","H04W 80\/02","H04L 1\/0061","Y02D 30\/70"]}
