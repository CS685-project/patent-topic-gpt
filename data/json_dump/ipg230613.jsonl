{"patent_number": "US-11678429-B2", "abstract": "An inertial electrostatic confinement fusion device has a body defining an internal vacuum chamber cavity, the chamber having attached a pump to evacuate atmosphere to vacuum conditions, the chamber further having attached a source to inject a nuclear fusion fuel at a metered rate, the chamber further having within it a plurality of electrodes connected to a high voltage alternating current power supply such that at least one pair of electrodes consistently have electrical charge of opposite polarity and of equal magnitude, the distance between them defining an electrode gap. The assembly acts to control the specific relationship between the electrode gap and the applied power, both frequency and voltage, to excite ions of the nuclear fuel enough to generate fusion but alternate the electrode polarity sufficiently to prevent the ions from completely traversing the electrode gap, preventing electrode bombardment.", "cpc_id": ["H05H 3/06", "H05H 1/02", "G21B 1/03", "Y02E 30/10"]}
{"patent_number": "US-11678435-B2", "abstract": "An electronic device is provided and includes a wiring structure including a conductive wiring and an insulating layer. The conductive wiring is disposed on a substrate and has a top side and two side walls opposite to each other. The insulating layer wraps around the conductive wiring at least through the top side and two side walls, wherein there is a gap between the insulating layer and at least one of the two side walls. The conductive wiring includes a first layer, a second layer and a third layer, the second layer is disposed between the first layer and the third layer, and the first layer is disposed between the second layer and the substrate. A thickness of the second layer is greater than a thickness of the first layer, and the thickness of the second layer is greater than a thickness of the third layer.", "cpc_id": ["H05K 1/028", "H05K 1/11", "H05K 1/18", "H05K 2201/0373", "H05K 3/28", "H05K 2201/0969", "H01L 23/4985", "H01L 51/0097", "H01L 27/3288", "H01L 27/3276", "Y02E 10/549"]}
{"patent_number": "US-11678504-B2", "abstract": "A display device includes a substrate including a display area including a plurality of pixels and a non-display area positioned around the display area and including a bending portion. A first protection layer is at one surface of the bending portion and a second protection layer entirely covers one surface of the bending portion, the second protection layer being positioned outermost of the substrate and the first protection layer based on a center of a curvature radius of the bending portion. The second protection layer is thinner than the first protection layer. The second protection layer has at least one end portion which directly contacts the substrate.", "cpc_id": ["H01L 51/5253", "H01L 27/3262", "H01L 27/3276", "H01L 51/5281", "H01L 51/56", "H01L 51/5256", "H01L 2251/5338", "H01L 51/524", "H01L 51/0097", "H01L 51/5246", "H01L 2251/558", "G06F 2203/04103", "G06F 1/1637", "G06F 3/041", "Y02E 10/549", "Y02P 70/50"]}
