The control circuitry may also be configured to provide occupancy information bearing on the number of occupants in the field of view to a remote entity via the communication interface.","cpc_id":["H05B 41\/325","H05B 41\/3922","H05B 41\/32","H05B 39\/042","H05B 33\/0869","H05B 3\/38","H05B 33\/08","H05B 37\/0272","H05B 37\/02","H05B 37\/0227","H05B 37\/0218","H05B 39\/081","G03B 15\/05","F21V 23\/0442","G05B 11\/017","G06T 2207\/10016","G06T 7\/2033","G06T 7\/20","G06K 9\/3241","G06K 9\/00771","G08B 13\/193","Y02B 20\/46","Y02B 20\/14","H01H 47\/24","H01J 40\/14","H01J 17\/04"]}
{"patent_number":"US-10165660-B2","abstract":"A low-voltage controller (LVC) is configured to utilize a low-voltage signal to operate a high-voltage load, such as, for example, a lamp. The LVC is configured to receive a low-voltage step signal at a switch input. The LVC has a line input for connection to a source of power at a line voltage and a load output for connection to a load, and a dimmer for setting an intensity of the load. Subsequent step signals alter the intensity of the load. A method for low-voltage control of a lamp is provided. A method includes the steps of receiving a first switch signal at a switch input of an LVC; setting the lamp to a first intensity; receiving a second switch signal at the switch input; and setting the lamp to a second intensity.","cpc_id":["Y02B 20\/46","H05B 37\/02","H05B 37\/0272"]}
