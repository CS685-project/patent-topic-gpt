Due to current pandemic scenario many organizations eventually need to plan for the return of employees to office space ensuring biosafety. The challenge of maximizing the office space utilization ensuring occupants biosafety and comfort thereby minimizing HVAC energy consumption is necessary. The method utilizes two heuristic approaches for determining maximum allowable occupants placement in the open plan space using an optimal occupant placement technique. This minimizes the HVAC energy if the actual count is lesser than the possible maximum occupants can be placed which further optimizes energy using a joint actuator control technique. Additionally, the proposed two heuristic approaches improve space utilization for the infection rate ensuring bio safety. Full utilization of open plan space is possible when the community infection rate and exposure duration are relatively low resulting low risk probability for uninfected occupants.","cpc_id":["F24F 11\/63","F24F 11\/46","F24F 2120\/12","F24F 2140\/50","F24F 2140\/60","F24F 2110\/65","F24F 2120\/10","Y02B 30\/70","G06Q 10\/06375","G06Q 50\/06","G06Q 10\/0635"]}
