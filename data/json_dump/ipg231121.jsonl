{"patent_number":"US-11823446-B2","abstract":"Digital imagery can help to quantify seasonal changes in desirable crop phenotypes that can be treated as quantitative traits. Because limitations in precise and functional phenotyping restrain genetic improvement in the post-genomic era, imagery-based phenomics could become the next breakthrough to accelerate genetic gains in field crops. Whereas many phenomic studies focus on exploratory analysis of spectral data without obvious interpretative value, we used field images to directly measure soybean canopy development from phenological stage V2 to R5. Over three years, we collected imagery using ground and aerial platforms of a large and diverse nested association panel comprising 5,555 lines. Genome-wide association analysis of canopy coverage across sampling dates detected a large quantitative trait locus on soybean (Glycine max, L. Merr.) chromosome 19. This QTL provided an increase in yield of 47.3 kg\u00b7ha\u22121. Variance component analysis indicated that a parameter, described as average canopy coverage, is a highly heritable trait (h2=0.77) with a promising genetic correlation with grain yield (0.87), enabling indirect selection of yield via canopy development parameters. Our findings indicate that fast canopy coverage is an early season trait that is inexpensive to measure and has great potential for application in breeding programs focused on yield improvement. We recommend using the average canopy coverage in multiple trait schemes, especially for the early stages of the breeding pipeline (including progeny rows and preliminary yield trials), in which the large number of field plots makes collection of grain yield data challenging.","cpc_id":["C12N 15\/8261","C12N 15\/8262","C12N 15\/8267","Y02A 40\/146","Y02A 40\/10","A01H 1\/04","A01H 3\/00","A01H 1\/00","A01H 1\/045","A01H 1\/12","A01H 1\/121","A01H 6\/542","A01H 1\/021","A01H 5\/12","G06V 20\/188","G06V 20\/17","G06V 20\/13","G06V 20\/10","G16B 20\/00","G16B 20\/40","G16B 45\/00","G16B 50\/20","G16B 50\/30","G16B 40\/00","G16B 25\/00","G16B 30\/00","G16B 20\/20","G16B 30\/10","G16B 5\/00","G16B 50\/00","C12Q 1\/6895","C12Q 2600\/13","C12Q 2600\/156","C12Q 2600\/172","A23L 11\/03","A23L 11\/07"]}

{"patent_number":"US-11823974-B2","abstract":"Systems and\/or methods can provide for solid-state refrigeration below 1 degree Kelvin. By applying a simple sequence of ac electrical signals to a gated semiconductor device, electrons are cooled in a refrigeration sequence that, in turn, provides cooling directly to the heat load of interest. Electrons in a single subband of a semiconductor quantum well are expanded adiabatically into several subbands, resulting in a temperature drop. Repeated application of this cycle at MHz-GHz frequencies results in a significant cooling power. The anticipated cooling powers can compete with today's standard cryogenic system, the dilution refrigerator, which represents the market standard for achieving cryogenic temperatures.","cpc_id":["F25B 1\/00","F25B 21\/00","F25B 2321\/003","H01L 23\/3738","H01L 23\/445","Y02B 30\/00"]}
