A person operating the pruning shears (102) produces discernible separation strokes when the handles (104) of the shears (102) are squeezed together to produce a shearing action. The stroke detector (108) detects the separation strokes of the shears (102). By the addition of the control module (108) to the pruning shears (102), the shears are essentially converted into a data logging device by means of which important aspects of a produce harvesting process can be digitised and supplied to a harvest data digital data processing system.","cpc_id":["A01D 1\/14","A01D 1\/00","A01D 45\/00","A01D 41\/127","A01D 41\/1271","A01B 79\/005","A01G 3\/02","H01H 36\/0033","Y02A 40\/10","G05B 23\/0221","G05B 23\/0283","G05B 19\/41865","G06N 20\/00","G06N 3\/02","G06N 3\/126","G06Q 50\/02","G06Q 50\/00"]}

The manifold is moved between the positions by way of an actuator driven linkage, and the aeration spears comprise hollow elongated bodies of tapered thickness toward their distal ends for more effective penetration of the hay bales. A manufacturing method uses a hydraulic press to produce the hollow elongated bodies from lengths of originally cylindrically pipe. Horizontal feeding tables and upright feeding racks feature displaceable bale movers for moving queued hay bales along one or more queuing lanes into one or more bale dryers.","cpc_id":["A01F 25\/12","A01D 87\/127","F26B 3\/06","F26B 9\/10","F26B 21\/00","F26B 21\/004","F26B 25\/02","F26B 2200\/02","F26B 2200\/10","Y02A 40\/51"]}

The RF receiver uses an RF sub-sampling technique to check for the RF signals and then put the RF receiver to sleep for a sleep time that is longer than a packet length of a transmitted packet to thus conserve battery power and lengthen the lifetime of the batteries. The RF receiver compares detected RF energy to a detect threshold that may be increased to decrease the sensitivity of the RF receiver and increase the lifetime of the batteries. After detecting that an RF signal is being transmitted, the RF receiver is put to sleep for a snooze time period that is longer than the sleep time and just slightly shorter than the time between two consecutive transmitted packets to further conserve battery power.","cpc_id":["E06B 9\/38","E06B 9\/68","E06B 9\/72","E06B 9\/70","E06B 9\/322","E06B 9\/32","E06B 2009\/6872","E06B 2009\/6818","E06B 2009\/2625","E06B 9\/62","H04W 52\/0245","H04W 52\/0238","H04W 52\/0287","Y02D 70\/12","Y02D 70\/122","Y02D 70\/00","Y02A 30\/257","Y02B 80\/50"]}
