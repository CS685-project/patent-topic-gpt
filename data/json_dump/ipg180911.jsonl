{"patent_number": "US-10075939-B2", "abstract": "A method and system for allocating shareable wireless transmission resources. A resource pool is established. The resource pool is divided into a plurality of physical layer allocation units usable for wirelessly transmitting control information and traffic data. The allocation units are assigned at the media access control layer for the wireless transmission of the control information and traffic data. The system and method of the present invention also allows mobile stations to be dynamically grouped into multicast groupings to reduce system overhead resource requirements.", "cpc_id": ["H04B 7/0413", "H04L 12/185", "H04L 1/1887", "H04L 27/2627", "H04L 5/023", "H04L 61/2069", "H04W 48/10", "H04W 4/08", "H04W 72/005", "H04W 72/04", "H04W 72/0406", "H04W 74/004", "H04W 74/006", "Y02B 60/43"]}

{"patent_number": "US-10076067-B2", "abstract": "A system and method of controlling a cooling fan in an information handling system is disclosed. A fan request signal is received from a component of an information handling system and a determination is made regarding whether the component is configured to operate with a cooling fan. If the component is configured to operate with the cooling fan, the fan request signal is transmitted to the cooling fan. If, on the other hand, the component is not configured to operate with the cooling fan, a revised fan request signal is generated and transmitted to the cooling fan.", "cpc_id": ["G06F 1/20", "G06F 1/203", "G06F 1/206", "Y02D 10/16"]}
