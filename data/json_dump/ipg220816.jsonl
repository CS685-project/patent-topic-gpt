The computation problem relates to evaluation of candidate solutions for external power flows into a power grid, with respect to predetermined constraints and contingencies. Storage and computations are reduced by formulating the problem in terms of transactional nodes (e.g. third party connections for generators and loads) instead of the larger number of bus nodes. Further advantages are achieved by precomputing matrices that can be reused across multiple SFT invocations, organizing matrices and operations to reduce storage and computation, and eliminating branches that have no contingency violations.

{"patent_number":"US-11419068-B2","abstract":"A large-scale MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) wireless transmission method for millimeter wave\/Terahertz networks is provided. In order to reduce the interruption of propagation in the millimeter wave\/Terahertz band, a plurality of cells are combined into a wireless transmission network, the base station in each cell is equipped with a large-scale antenna array, and a unitary transformation matrix is used to achieve large-scale beam coverage for user terminals in the entire network. Moreover, in order to reduce the influence of the multipath and Doppler effects on transmission performance, received signals are synchronized for time and frequency in each receiving beam of a user terminal. The method allocates power for signal transmission according to the statistic information of synchronized equivalent channels, and gives an optimal power allocation matrix by iterative solution based on the CCCP (concave-convex procedure) and the deterministic equivalent method.","cpc_id":["H04W 52\/42","H04W 56\/005","H04W 72\/0473","H04W 52\/267","H04B 7\/0452","H04B 7\/0413","H04B 7\/0617","H04B 7\/043","H04B 7\/0695","H04B 7\/0626","H04B 7\/0408","H04B 7\/088","H04B 7\/06","H04B 7\/0426","H04B 17\/382","H04B 7\/0656","H04B 7\/0897","H04B 17\/309","H04L 5\/0037","H04L 5\/0023","Y02D 30\/70"]}
