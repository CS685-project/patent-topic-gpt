Accordingly, a user is capable of conveniently using a sensor and a switch together.","cpc_id":["H05B 37\/02","H05B 37\/0227","H05B 37\/0245","H05B 37\/0263","H05B 37\/0272","H05B 33\/0854","H05B 33\/0872","F21V 23\/06","F21V 23\/0471","F21V 23\/003","F21V 23\/0464","F21V 23\/471","Y02B 20\/48","F21Y 2115\/10"]}
{"patent_number":"US-10034352-B2","abstract":"The present disclosure relates to determining one or more of a space occupancy score, space energy score, and space efficiency score for a collection of lighting endpoints in a lighting network. The space occupancy score is indicative of how effective the occupancy groups are configured for a given space or the utilization level for a space. The space energy score is indicative of how much energy the collection of lighting endpoints use or will likely use based on their configurations, actual use, or a combination thereof. The space efficiency score is indicative of the overall efficiency associated with the collection of lighting endpoints based on both occupancy and energy related metrics.","cpc_id":["H05B 37\/0227","H05B 37\/0272","H05B 37\/0254","H05B 33\/0842","H05B 37\/0218","H05B 33\/0872","H05B 37\/02","H05B 37\/0245","H05B 6\/682","H05B 39\/02","Y02B 20\/46","Y02B 20\/44","Y02B 20\/48","H02J 2003\/003","H02J 3\/14","G05B 13\/028","G05B 13\/029","G05B 13\/0295"]}
{"patent_number":"US-10034356-B2","abstract":"The present disclosure provides a smart lighting device, and a smart lighting control system and method. The smart lighting device includes a wireless communication module, a control module, an image acquisition module configured to collect images\/videos near the smart lighting device in real-time and to send the images\/videos to the control module for analysis, and a microphone module configured to have operation modes including a sleep mode and a monitor mode to receive a control signal from the control module to switch between the operation modes, and to collect audio signals in the surrounding area of the smart lighting device when operated at the monitor mode. The control module is configured to receive and analyze the images\/videos from the image acquisition module. When a human appearance is identified in the images, the control module sends the control signal to the microphone module to switch to the monitor mode.","cpc_id":["H05B 37\/0227","H05B 37\/0272","H05B 37\/0236","H05B 33\/0842","H05B 37\/0218","H05B 37\/0245","H05B 33\/0803","H05B 37\/0209","H05B 33\/0854","H05B 37\/02","H05B 37\/029","Y02B 20\/48","Y02B 20\/383","Y02B 20\/40","Y02B 20\/44","Y02B 20\/46","Y02B 20\/19","Y02B 20\/42","Y02B 20\/445","Y02B 20\/72","Y02B 60\/34","Y02B 60\/50","G06K 9\/00302","G06K 9\/00228","G10L 25\/63","G10L 15\/22","G10L 21\/0208","G10L 25\/84","G10L 17\/24","G10L 15\/08","G10L 2015\/227","G10L 15\/24","G10L 2015\/223","G10L 15\/26","G10L 2015\/088","G10L 13\/027","H04L 12\/2803","G06F 3\/00","G06F 3\/01","G06F 3\/167"]}
