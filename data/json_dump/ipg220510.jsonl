Each of the control pods may in turn control several lights in a growing zone. Each zone may have its own lighting schedule to promote optimal plant development. Each of the control pods may also gather environmental or operational information and return that information to the primary control pod and ultimately to a remote computing device.", "cpc_id": ["H05B 47/11", "H05B 45/20", "H05B 47/105", "H05B 47/175", "H05B 45/12", "H05B 47/10", "H05B 47/115", "H05B 47/125", "H05B 47/16", "H05B 47/165", "A01G 31/06", "A01G 7/045", "A01G 9/249", "A01G 7/00", "A01G 2031/006", "A01G 27/003", "A01G 31/02", "A01G 9/023", "A01G 9/24", "A01G 9/246", "A01G 9/247", "A01G 9/26", "A01G 25/16", "A01G 27/001", "A01G 27/005", "A01G 31/00", "A01G 9/16", "A01G 9/18", "A01G 9/20", "A01G 13/06", "A01G 24/10", "A01G 24/15", "A01G 24/18", "A01G 24/25", "A01G 24/28", "A01G 24/46", "A01G 27/008", "A01G 27/02", "A01G 31/04", "A01G 31/047", "A01G 7/06", "A01G 9/022", "A01G 9/025", "A01G 9/027", "A01G 9/029", "A01G 9/0293", "A01G 9/14", "A01G 9/1423", "Y02A 40/25"]}
