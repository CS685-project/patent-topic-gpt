Over a plurality of repetitions of the duty cycle the energy is transmitted at each of the plurality of frequencies for the respective transmission duration.","cpc_id":["H05B 6\/688","H05B 6\/6447","H05B 6\/687","H05B 6\/68","H05B 6\/705","H05B 6\/664","H05B 6\/70","Y02B 40\/143","Y02B 40\/146"]}
{"patent_number":"US-10687403-B2","abstract":"An adaptive lighting system (100), a (virtual) mirror arrangement, a method of controlling light sources of an adaptive light sources, a method of controlling a virtual mirror and a computer program product are provided. The adaptive lighting system is for a mirror component that is configured to show a mirror image of the user at the mirror surface of the mirror component. The adaptive lighting system comprises a plurality of individually controllable light sources (111 . . . 119), a sensor (102), and a controller (104). The sensor detects a relative orientation of the head of the user with respect to the mirror surface. The controller generates control signals (121 . . . 129) for the individually controllable light sources on the basis of the sensor signal. The controller generates the control signals to obtain a lower emission of light towards eyes of the user if the sensor signal indicates that the head is turned left sidewards, upwards, right sidewards and\/or downwards.","cpc_id":["A45D 42\/10","A47G 1\/02","F21V 33\/004","G06F 3\/012","G06F 3\/013","G06K 9\/00362","G06T 2207\/30196","G06T 7\/20","G06T 7\/50","G06T 7\/70","H05B 47\/105","H05B 47\/11","Y02B 20\/46"]}
{"patent_number":"US-10687404-B2","abstract":"According to a concept of the invention, there is proposed a communication interface that enables communication and power transfer between a luminaire and a connectable module. The communication interface comprises a driver circuit which generates an AC power supply for a primary winding, the primary winding being magnetically couplable to a secondary winding for powering the connectable module. A data sensing arrangement is adapted to detect a variation in the voltage\/current of the primary winding which has been induced by the secondary winding. A control arrangement selectively couples a first and second DC input, upon which the AC power supply is based, together or to a common voltage.","cpc_id":["H05B 37\/0254","H05B 33\/0803","H05B 33\/0815","H05B 33\/0893","H05B 37\/0209","H05B 37\/0227","H05B 37\/0272","H05B 33\/0887","H01F 38\/14","H02J 5\/005","H02J 50\/10","H02J 50\/40","H02M 3\/33507","Y02B 20\/346"]}
