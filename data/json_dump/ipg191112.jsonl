{"patent_number":"US-10477469-B2","abstract":"Within many applications impulse radio based ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) transmission offers significant benefits for very short range high data rate communications when compared with existing standards and protocols. In many of these applications the main design goals are very low power consumption and very low complexity design for easy integration and cost reduction. Digitally programmable IR-UWB transmitters using an on-off keying modulation scheme on a 0.13 microns CMOS process operating on 1.2 V supply and yielding power consumption as low as 0.9 mW at a 10 Mbps data rate with dynamic power control are enabled. The IR-UWB transmitters support new frequency hopping techniques providing more efficient spectrum usage and dynamic allocation of the spectrum when transmitting in highly congested frequency bands. Biphasic scrambling is also introduced for spectral line reduction. Additionally, an energy detection receiver for IR-UWB is presented to similarly meet these design goals while being adaptable to address IR-UWB transmitter specificity.","cpc_id":["H04B 5\/02","H04B 1\/713","H04B 1\/7172","H04B 1\/71632","H04B 1\/71635","H04B 5\/0075","H04W 52\/02","G03B 21\/00","G03B 21\/26","H04N 9\/3194","G06F 3\/0488","G06F 3\/04845","G06F 3\/0482","G06F 3\/048","G06F 3\/0426","G06F 3\/0425","G06F 3\/042","G06F 3\/041","G06F 3\/0346","G06F 3\/0304","G06F 3\/017","G06F 1\/163","G06F 3\/04886","Y02D 70\/164","Y02D 70\/40","Y02D 70\/166","Y02D 70\/42","Y02D 70\/1242","Y02D 70\/1224","Y02D 70\/142","Y02D 70\/144","Y02D 70\/146","Y02D 70\/00"]}

In some embodiments, microwave interference mitigation involves coordinating wireless traffic in accordance with a magnetron's on-and-off cycle so that data is not sent during the magnetron's on period, and is exclusively sent during the magnetron's off period. Wireless traffic can be coordinated using a voltage monitoring and zero-crossing point detection technique coupled with a Clear To Send (CTS) packet. For non-microwave devices, wireless traffic coordination can be achieved using a pattern matching algorithm coupled with a Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) threshold adjustment during the magnetron's on-and-off cycles.
