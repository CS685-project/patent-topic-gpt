          "A power unit including multiple generators supplies power to a load or loads that may be variable. The generators can differ, e.g., in generating capacities, rates at which their outputs can be changed, maintenance requirements, and/or different energy-conversion efficiencies. A control unit throttles the generators independently according to a digitally implemented algorithm that may, but need not, use the difference(s) in supplying power to the load. In some cases, the controller regulates monitored power delivered to the load or loads. A power combiner is connected to the outputs of the generators. If desired, a buffer can be used between the generators and the load or loads to provide energy storage that can allow for the load or loads to change at a faster rate than the generators are throttled and for peak loads that temporarily exceed the capacity of the generators.",

In the first mode, power is transferred between the object and the second power supply circuit. In the second mode, power is transferred between the object and each of the first and second power supply circuits. The control device starts supplying the second AC power to the object in the first mode, and when a power supply current becomes larger than a first threshold, supply the first and second AC power to the object in the second mode.",

The power converter is coupled to the power source and supplies the load. During operation of the power converter, a common mode current flows from the load to the ground node via a leakage capacitance. The leakage current cancelation circuit receives at least one signal indicative of the common mode current and generates a leakage cancelation current that is injected into at least one node of the system. The leakage cancelation current has a magnitude opposite a magnitude of the common mode current. For example, the leakage current cancelation circuit receives supply voltage signals output by the power converter, and generates and supplies the leakage cancelation current onto input nodes of the power converter such that a current level on the ground node is between −3.0 milliamperes and +3.0 milliamperes.",

          "The present invention discloses a method and a process of producing ammonia from methane extracted from methane-hydrate at the site of methane-hydrate extraction. The method and the process comprise coupled chemical reactions. During the first reaction, carbon dioxide reacts methane-hydrate to produce carbon-dioxide-hydrate and methane: carbon dioxide+methane-hydrate⇄carbon-dioxide-hydrate+methane (CO2+CH4-hydrate⇄CO2-hydrate+CH4). The produced methane is reacted with water to produced carbon dioxide and hydrogen via the second reaction: methane+water⇄carbon dioxide+hydrogen (CH4+2H2O⇄CO2+4H2). One embodiment of the second reaction is a combination of the methane steam reforming reaction (CH4+H2O⇄CO+3H2) and the water-gas shift reaction (CO+H2O⇄CO2+H2), both are widely known in the art. The carbon dioxide produced in the second reaction is recycled and used for the first reaction. The hydrogen produced in the second reaction is reacted with nitrogen produced from an air separation process that is known in the art to produce ammonia via the third reaction: nitrogen+hydrogen→ammonia (N2+3H2→2NH3). One embodiment of the third reaction is the well-known Haber-Bosch process. The current invention is related to co-locating the ammonia synthesis at the methane-hydrate extraction sites to minimize the cost of transporting both methane and carbon dioxide over long distances. The process and the associated method also have the advantage of on-site carbon sequestration. The ammonia product produced via the current invention is easily transportable in liquid form from the production sites to the end-use sites as a carbon-free liquid fuel, a fertilizer and a chemical feedstock.",

          "A battery unit including a battery, a circuit board, a switching device which achieves charge or discharge of the battery, and a casing made up of a bottom and a peripheral wall. The battery is disposed on the bottom. The circuit board is arranged farther away from the bottom than from the battery. The switching device is located closer to the bottom than the circuit board is. The switching device has a visible area visually or optically perceived, as inwardly facing inside the casing from outside the circuit board, and includes a data-retaining area on which data on characteristics of the switching device is provided, for example, in the form of a code. This structure facilitates the ease with which the data on the characteristics of the switching device is visually or optically read out of the data-retaining area without having to have an increased size of the battery unit.",
          "A battery tester housing unit comprising a face plate wherein said face plate faces forwardly and extends in a transverse direction to terminate at a lateral edge, a back plate wherein said back plate faces backwardly and is parallel to said face plate; a surrounding wall which surrounds a peripheral of said base plate and said back plate; a digital display in rectangular shape located on said face plate located on a first end of the face plate; a battery holder apparatus in half cylindrical opening having a positive end and a negative end; said battery holder apparatus is located on a second end of said face plate wherein said second end is located opposite to said first end on said face plate; a first button located in proximity to said digital display; a second button located in proximity to said display and said first button; a third button, a fourth button, a fifth button and a sixth button located in proximity to said battery holder apparatus.",

It is recognized herein that these requirements may pose a challenge for data or resource exchange between two service layer (SL) entities, for example, because resource representations to be exchanged may have too large a size to be supported by the underlying networks. In some cases, traditional data compression algorithms can be used to alleviate this problem to some degree, but it is recognized herein that there are associated computation costs due to compression and decompression that may not be affordable for constrained IoT devices. Various embodiments described herein address this problem, among others, by defining a Resource Representation Common Part (RRCP) and storing it at the service layer.

Due to current pandemic scenario many organizations eventually need to plan for the return of employees to office space ensuring biosafety. The challenge of maximizing the office space utilization ensuring occupants biosafety and comfort thereby minimizing HVAC energy consumption is necessary. The method utilizes two heuristic approaches for determining maximum allowable occupants placement in the open plan space using an optimal occupant placement technique. This minimizes the HVAC energy if the actual count is lesser than the possible maximum occupants can be placed which further optimizes energy using a joint actuator control technique. Additionally, the proposed two heuristic approaches improve space utilization for the infection rate ensuring bio safety. Full utilization of open plan space is possible when the community infection rate and exposure duration are relatively low resulting low risk probability for uninfected occupants.',\n",
