This enables a very attractive combination of low power consumption and high selectivity. The network supports these receivers by adopting a wakeup message structure that supports oscillator frequency calibration, and that tolerates loss of parts of the signal spectrum. Wakeup signals are transmitted frequently to allow the wakeup receivers (whether targeted by a wakeup signal or not) to calibrate their LO frequencies. The frequencies of the wakeup signals can be constant, or follow a hopping pattern for increased immunity to interference. The wakeup signals can use multiple carriers to increase robustness to loss of parts of the signal spectrum, particularly near the LO frequency in a homodyne receiver. The carriers use amplitude modulation (OOK), with either different or equal sequences. Having equal sequences provides an opportunity for increased sensitivity by mixing all carriers to the same frequency before amplitude detection and correlation.', 'cpc_id': ['H04W 52/0229', 'H04W 52/0235', 'H04W 72/0453', 'Y02D 30/70']}\n",
